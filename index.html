  <h1>Welcome to Neuroscience Explorer</h1>
  <p>This page is dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of neuroscience, brain signal analysis, and intraoperative neuromonitoring.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ‘¤ About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Semparuthi A</strong>, a neuroscience enthusiast and clinical neurophysiology specialist based in South India. Over the past several years, Iâ€™ve participated in more than <strong>1000 surgeries</strong> across leading hospitals, providing critical <strong>Intraoperative Neuromonitoring (IONM)</strong> support to protect patients' neural pathways during complex procedures.</p>
  <p>My journey began in the operating room, where I witnessed the power of real-time neural monitoring. That experience sparked a deeper interest in understanding the brainâ€™s electrical signalsâ€”especially through <strong>EEG</strong> and evoked potentials like <strongBERA</strong>. Today, Iâ€™m focused on integrating BERA analysis with advanced EEG tools like <strong>BESA Research</strong> to uncover new insights into auditory processing and brain connectivity.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ§¬ What Is Neuroscience?</h2>
  <p>Neuroscience is the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nervous system. It helps us understand how we think, feel, move, and learn. Researchers use tools like EEG, fMRI, and MEG to observe brain activity and decode how neurons communicate.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ§ª What Is IONM?</h2>
  <p><strong>Intraoperative Neuromonitoring (IONM)</strong> is a technique used during surgeries to monitor the nervous system in real time. It helps surgeons avoid damaging critical brain and spinal cord pathways.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tracks motor and sensory signals during surgery</li>
    <li>Alerts surgeons to potential nerve damage</li>
    <li>Uses EEG, EMG, and evoked potentials like SSEP, MEP, and BERA</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ðŸ§  EEG and BERA: My Current Focus</h2>
  <p>After years of hands-on IONM experience, Iâ€™ve shifted my focus to the analysis of <strong>EEG signals</strong>â€”especially auditory evoked potentials like <strong>BERA (Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry)</strong>. My goal is to bridge clinical neurophysiology with advanced research tools to better understand how the brain processes sound.</p>
  <p>Iâ€™m currently exploring how BERA data can be integrated into <strong>BESA Research</strong> for source localization, ERP extraction, and time-frequency analysis. This could open new doors in diagnosing auditory disorders and mapping brainstem activity.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ”¬ What Is BESA Research?</h2>
  <p><strong>BESA Research</strong> is a powerful software used by neuroscientists to analyze EEG and MEG data. It helps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clean noisy brain signals</li>
    <li>Extract ERP (Event-Related Potential) responses</li>
    <li>Localize brain activity using head models like FEM and BEM</li>
    <li>Visualize brain connectivity and time-frequency patterns</li>
  </ul>
