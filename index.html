<h2>ðŸ‘¤ About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Semparuthi A</strong>, a passionate neuroscience enthusiast with a keen interest in brain signal analysis, intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM), and EEG research. I enjoy exploring how technology and biology intersect to improve patient outcomes and deepen our understanding of the human brain.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve worked with tools like <strong>BESA Research</strong> to analyze ERP signals and localize brain activity using advanced head models like FEM and BEM. My goal is to make neuroscience more accessible and impactful through education and innovation.</p>
<p>Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/semparuthi999/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> to learn more or collaborate!</p>

  <h1>Welcome to Neuroscience Explorer</h1>
  <p>Neuroscience is the study of the brain and nervous system. It helps us understand how we think, feel, move, and learn.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ§¬ What Is Neuroscience?</h2>
  <p>Neuroscience explores how the brain and nerves control everything we doâ€”from thoughts and emotions to movement and memory. Scientists use tools like EEG, fMRI, and MEG to study brain activity.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ§ª What Is IONM?</h2>
  <p>Intraoperative Neuromonitoring (IONM) is used during surgeries to monitor the nervous system in real time. It helps protect critical brain and spinal cord pathways.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tracks motor and sensory signals</li>
    <li>Alerts surgeons to nerve damage</li>
    <li>Uses EEG, EMG, and evoked potentials</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ðŸ§  What Is BESA Research?</h2>
  <p>BESA Research is software used to analyze EEG and MEG data. It helps scientists clean noisy signals, extract ERP responses, and localize brain activity using head models
